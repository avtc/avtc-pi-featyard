/**
 * Post-turn follow-up dispatch — defers phase-transition followUp delivery to
 * the agent-settled boundary.
 *
 * WHY this exists. pi drains a `deliverAs: "followUp"` message queued *during* a
 * turn INSIDE the same agent loop (via the loop's `getFollowUpMessages`), so an
 * inline dispatch would run in the same agent cycle as the dispatching turn. That
 * broke the once-per-turn `phase_ready` guard: a phase-transition followUp
 * dispatched inline ran before `agent_end` reset the guard, so the followUp
 * skill's own `phase_ready` was silently deduped.
 *
 * THE FIX. Phase-transition followUps are not dispatched inline. They are staged
 * here via {@link schedulePostTurnFollowUp} and drained by the `agent_settled`
 * handler via {@link schedulePostTurnDrain}. `agent_settled` is the per-prompt
 * boundary at which pi has no pending retry/compaction/followUp continuation —
 * the moment pi will not continue running automatically. Draining there (instead
 * of at `agent_end`) means the staged followUp does not race a concurrently typed
 * user message: a user followUp queued during the run keeps pi in its post-run
 * loop, so `agent_settled` (and thus the drain) only fires once that user message
 * has been processed.
 *
 * The drain is DEFERRED (~{@link DRAIN_DELAY_MS}) rather than synchronous because
 * the `agent_settled` handler runs inside `_runAgentPrompt`'s `finally`; a
 * synchronous `sendUserMessage` there would re-enter `_runAgentPrompt` before the
 * outer run unwinds. The delay also lets a user message being typed at settle
 * time start its turn first — when the deferred drain fires, that turn is
 * streaming and the followUp enqueues behind it (FIFO) instead of jumping ahead.
 * This mirrors the compaction re-inject pattern (`scheduleDeferredFollowUp`).
 *
 * Mechanics (verified in pi-agent-core 0.80.6): at `agent_settled`,
 * `session.isStreaming === false` (`_isAgentRunActive` is cleared before the
 * event fires), so `sendUserMessage` takes the idle branch and starts a fresh
 * `_runAgentPrompt` — a new agent cycle with its own `agent_start…agent_settled`.
 * The `phase_ready` guard is reset on `agent_end` (per-cycle), so the new cycle's
 * `phase_ready` honors correctly.
 *
 * Compaction supersedes a staged followUp: when `session_compact` fires with a
 * staged followUp present (only possible for pi's own auto-compaction, which runs
 * in `_handlePostAgentRun` *before* `agent_settled` drains — extension
 * `ctx.compact()` never stages one), the compaction handler clears the slot via
 * {@link hasPostTurnFollowUp}/{@link clearPostTurnFollowUp} and injects its own
 * skill+framing message instead. Without this, both the compaction's editor-write
 * and this drain would deliver the same transition (redundant editor paste).
 *
 * Module-level single slot: at most one phase-transition followUp is staged per
 * turn (the once-per-turn guard guarantees at most one honoring), and the slot +
 * pending timer are cleared on drain and on session/reset teardown.
